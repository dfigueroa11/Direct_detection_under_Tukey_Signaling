# Direct_detection_under_Tukey_Signaling

Implementation of the system proposed by Amir Tasbihi and Frank R. Kschischang in [1] for recovering the phase information when using direct detection. 

The system is based in the so called Tukey Signaling, and the introduction of controlled ISI in the symbols.
